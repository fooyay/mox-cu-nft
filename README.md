# Moccasin NFT Project

🐍 Exploring how to build NFTs using Moccasin

## Quickstart

1. Deploy to a fake local network that titanoboa automatically spins up!

```bash
mox run deploy
```

2. Run tests

```
mox test
```

## Game Plan
- [x] Create a basic NFT contract
- [x] Workshop: change NFT image to my own art (a monkey)
- [x] Workshop: add tests for basic_nft contract
- [ ] Create a mood NFT contract that changes the image based on mood

_For documentation, please run `mox --help` or visit [the Moccasin documentation](https://cyfrin.github.io/moccasin)_
